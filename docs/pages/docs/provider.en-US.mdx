# Provider

The **Provider** manages configuration for all hooks using [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) (not to be confused with an [Ethereum Provider](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/) of course).

```tsx
import { Provider } from 'wagmi'
```

To help avoid conflicts with other providers in your app, the **Provider** is also aliased as **WagmiProvider**.

```tsx
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi'
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { Provider } from 'wagmi'

const App = () => (
  <Provider>
    <YourRoutes />
  </Provider>
)
```

<Callout>
  You can specify multiple configuration options, such as: connectors (i.e.
  WalletConnect), auto-connection, websockets, etc, by passing a "wagmi client"
  instance to the `Provider` via the `client` prop. [See
  below](#client-optional)
</Callout>

## Configuration

### client (optional)

A "wagmi client" instance that consists of configuration options. [Read more](/client)

```tsx highlight='4'
import { Provider, createClient } from 'wagmi'

const client = createClient({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors,
  provider,
})

const App = () => (
  <Provider client={client}>
    <YourRoutes />
  </Provider>
)
```
